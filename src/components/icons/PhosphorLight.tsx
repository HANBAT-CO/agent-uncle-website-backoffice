 * Phosphor Light icons for media and form chrome (spec 4.5): Play, Pause,
 * SpeakerHigh, SpeakerSlash, CornersOut, WarningCircle, ArrowCounterClockwise,
 * Minus and Plus.
 *
 * The path data is the "light" weight copied verbatim from
 * @phosphor-icons/react 2.1 (MIT), and the <svg> carries the same attributes
 * the package's IconBase renders (256 viewBox, currentColor fill, square size).
 * The package's own components bundle all six weights of every icon plus a
 * context provider (about 7 KB gzip for these nine); the page only ever uses
 * the light weight, so these plain components keep the initial JS small and
 * render the same pixels. Server-safe: no hooks, no context.
